# **Customer-Centric Development: Putting Users First**  

## **Introduction**  
Odigos thrives on its ability to seamlessly deliver observability with minimal overhead. To maintain and increase adoption, it’s essential to stay attuned to user needs and experiences. A customer-centric approach not only ensures product relevance but also builds lasting relationships with the user community.  

As a Product Manager, my focus will be on creating a user-centric product development strategy by actively gathering feedback, addressing pain points, and continually improving the overall user experience.

## **Key Objectives:**  
1. **Enhance User Onboarding:**  
   - Simplify the setup process with guided walkthroughs and interactive tutorials.  
   - Provide pre-configured dashboards tailored to different observability needs (e.g., performance monitoring, security analysis).  
   - Offer quick-start templates for popular tech stacks (e.g., Kubernetes, microservices, monolithic apps).  

2. **Streamline Feature Adoption:**  
   - Introduce in-product tips and contextual guidance to help users discover new features.  
   - Conduct user journey mapping to identify friction points.  
   - Implement an in-app feedback button to gather real-time user insights.  

3. **Foster Open Communication:**  
   - Establish feedback channels directly within the platform (e.g., feature requests, bug reports).  
   - Host regular community feedback sessions to discuss ongoing developments.  
   - Create a dedicated “User Voice” page to highlight top-voted ideas and progress on their implementation.  

4. **Prioritize Usability Testing:**  
   - Conduct usability testing sessions with real users from various technical backgrounds.  
   - Analyze interaction patterns to identify usability challenges.  
   - Utilize feedback from beta testers to iteratively refine features before wider release.  

5. **Personalized User Experience:**  
   - Implement customizable dashboards based on user roles (e.g., Developer, SRE, DevOps Engineer).  
   - Offer modular feature packs that users can enable or disable based on their observability needs.  
   - Tailor notifications and alerts based on the user’s role and preferences.
