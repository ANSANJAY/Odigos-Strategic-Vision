# **Odigos Product Roadmap**  

## **Introduction**  
Odigos has emerged as a trailblazer in the observability space, leveraging the power of üêùeBPF to deliver high-fidelity, low-overhead monitoring for modern cloud-native environments. As someone deeply passionate about product building and observability, I see immense potential in Odigos to become the default choice for developers and SREs looking to simplify monitoring without compromising performance.  

My journey from being an eBPF engineer to a Product Manager has given me a unique perspective on how to bridge technical innovation with product strategy. Having previously worked unofficially with the Odigos team and studied the APM market for over a year, I am confident in my ability to take Odigos to the next level.  

This roadmap outlines my strategic vision for Odigos, focusing on three key pillars:  
1. **User-Centric Development:** Ensuring that every feature and improvement directly enhances user experience and adoption.  
2. **Technical Excellence:** Leveraging eBPF‚Äôs strengths while optimizing performance and integration with cloud-native tools.  
3. **Community and Ecosystem Growth:** Building a thriving, engaged community around Odigos through collaboration and transparency.

## **Why This Project?**  
Odigos‚Äô ability to automatically instrument applications using eBPF üêù without requiring code changes makes it uniquely suited for modern observability challenges. However, to truly dominate the observability landscape, we must:
  
- **Enhance Usability:** Simplify onboarding and provide intuitive, context-driven dashboards.  
- **Drive Adoption:** Create impactful user stories that demonstrate the value of Odigos in real-world scenarios.  
- **Build a Collaborative Community:** Engage developers and SREs through community-driven feature requests and contributions.  

I am committed to leading these initiatives, driving technical excellence, and fostering community engagement to make Odigos an indispensable observability tool.
