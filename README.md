# **Odigos Strategic Vision**  

## **Introduction**  
Observability has always fascinated me ‚Äì the ability to gain deep insights into complex systems with minimal impact is a game changer. Odigos is leading this revolution, and I am passionate about being a part of this journey.  

Odigos has emerged as a trailblazer in the observability space, leveraging the power of üêùeBPF to deliver high-fidelity, low-overhead monitoring for modern cloud-native environments.  

As someone deeply passionate about product building and observability, I see immense potential in Odigos to become the default choice for developers and SREs looking to simplify monitoring without compromising performance.  

### **Why I‚Äôm Excited About Odigos:**  
- **Innovative Technology:** Uses üêùeBPF to provide automatic instrumentation with minimal performance impact.  
- **Community-Centric Approach:** As an open-source project, Odigos has built a foundation for collaborative innovation.  
- **Scalable Observability:** Tailored for cloud-native environments, making it versatile for modern applications.  

### **Why I‚Äôm the Right Fit:**  
- **Technical Expertise:** My journey from eBPF engineer to Product Manager has equipped me with the skills to bridge technical innovation and strategic planning.  
- **Hands-On Experience:** I have worked unofficially with the Odigos team and have practical insights into the project‚Äôs potential.  
- **Market Understanding:** One year of studying the APM market at AmEx has given me a clear perspective on observability challenges and opportunities.  
- **Product Passion:** Having built a product from scratch in a startup environment, I know what it takes to drive adoption and user satisfaction.  
- **Startup Mindset:** I thrive in dynamic environments where roles are fluid, allowing me to take on responsibilities as a PM, DevRel, or Sales Rep when needed.  
- **Unique Proposition:** My combination of hands-on eBPF experience, product strategy insights, and startup mindset positions me uniquely to drive Odigos‚Äô growth and innovation.  

This roadmap outlines my strategic vision for Odigos as a Product Manager, focusing on three key pillars:  
1. **User-Centric Development:** Enhancing user experience and adoption.  
2. **Technical Excellence:** Optimizing performance while leveraging eBPF.  
3. **Community and Ecosystem Growth:** Building an engaged, collaborative user base.
